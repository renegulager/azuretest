Notes:

Nearly all the tasks can be solved using an arm template except creating the resource group. That has to be done before creating all the other artifacts.

The network address is quite large, most networks don't need that kind of space. if I use the whole network cidr address /12 and splits it into tree quale parts,
it might give a problem in the future if we need to create other resource groups and route between them. With the current size(/24) of the subnet it possible to have 256(251 azure are reserving some) host in each
subnet and 4096 subnets in that virtual network.

The solution was developed in a couple of steps, the first "rough" POC was just a bash script that created a resource group and created a storage account using a JSON file ( not submitted to git). An
an improved version that created storage account with the specification from the task description( name, encryption), added the tags to the, creating networks using mostly static information.

Encryption is enabled by default from Microsoft on all kind of storage, that why it is not a part of the arm template.

Problems:
- I was not able to assign tags to the resource group using templates.
- It was not possible for me to create a policy template and apply it.

Time spend:
~7-8 hours in  tota
